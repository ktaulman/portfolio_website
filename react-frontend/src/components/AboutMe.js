        In April, I made the decision to dedicate myself coding full-time. After several years in sales, there was a desire to build something rather than sell it.

        Fortunately, I've been blessed enough to make learning my job! Self-teaching may seem like a lonesome endevour, but there's actually a great online support community!

        Currently, my interests lay in learning the MERN-stack and authentication. More long term goals include studying and implementing Accessibility, OOP principles, TDD, and data structures.
